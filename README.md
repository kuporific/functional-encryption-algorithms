# Exercises in Crypto Algorithms

This project is a collection of crypto algorithms implemented in a few languages I'm interested in. The purpose is purely for my own learning and fun.

## Algorithms implemented

- [ ] Caesar Cipher
  - [x] [Java](java/src/main/java/com/implementsblog/functional/CaesarCipher.java)
  - [x] [Clojure](clojure/functional-encryption-algorithms/src/functional\_encryption\_algorithms/caesar\_cipher.clj)
  - [x] [Ceylon](ceylon/functional-encryption-algorithms/source/com/implementsblog/functional/CaesarCipher.ceylon)
- [ ] Affine Cipher
  - [x] [Java](java/src/main/java/com/implementsblog/functional/AffineCipher.java)
  - [ ] Clojure
  - [ ] Ceylon
